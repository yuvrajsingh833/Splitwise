## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Vite** for development and building

### Backend
- **Node.js** with **Express**
- **SQLite** database for persistence
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- RESTful API design

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized setup)

### Option 1: Local Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command starts both the backend API server (port 3001) and the frontend development server (port 5173) concurrently.

3. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Option 2: Docker Setup (Recommended for Production)

1. **Quick setup with script:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/docker-setup.sh
   ```

2. **Or manually with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   # Build and start all services
   docker-compose up -d

   # View logs
   docker-compose logs -f

   # Stop services
   docker-compose down
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:3001`
   - Production (with Nginx): `http://localhost:80`

### Option 3: Development with Docker

For development with hot reload:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

## Docker Services

### Production Setup
- **backend**: Node.js API server with SQLite database
- **frontend**: React app served by Nginx
- **nginx**: Reverse proxy for production deployment (optional)

## Database Schema

### Tables
- **users**: User information (id, name, created_at)

## Environment Variables

### Frontend
- `VITE_API_URL`: Backend API URL (default: http://localhost:3001)

## Key Features Explained

### Balance Calculation Algorithm
The application implements sophisticated balance resolution:
1. Tracks all expense splits per user
2. Calculates gross amounts owed between each pair of users
3. Nets out mutual debts to minimize transactions
4. Provides simplified "who owes whom" summary

### Split Types
- **Equal Split**: Automatically divides expense amount by number of group members
- **Percentage Split**: Allows custom percentage allocation with validation (must total 100%)

### Real-time Updates
- Balances update immediately after adding expenses
- Group totals recalculate automatically
- Personal balance dashboard reflects all group changes

## Development

### Available Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start both frontend and backend in development mode
- `npm run dev:client` - Start only the frontend development server
- `npm run dev:server` - Start only the backend API server
- `npm run build` - Build the frontend for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build

### Database Management
The SQLite database (`splitwise.db`) is automatically created in the project root. In Docker, it's persisted in the `./data` volume. It includes:
- Automatic table creation on first run
- Sample user data for testing
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity

## Production Deployment

### With Docker Compose
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `docker-compose up -d`
3. Access via `http://localhost:80` (with Nginx) or `http://localhost:5173` (direct)

### Manual Deployment
1. Build frontend: `npm run build`
2. Serve `dist/` folder with any static file server
3. Deploy backend to any Node.js hosting service
4. Configure environment variables

## Assumptions Made

1. **No Authentication**: The application doesn't implement user authentication for simplicity
2. **No Payments**: Focus is on expense tracking and balance calculation, not actual payment processing
3. **SQLite Database**: Uses file-based SQLite instead of PostgreSQL for easier setup in development
4. **Sample Users**: Pre-seeds database with sample users for immediate testing
5. **Single Currency**: All amounts are assumed to be in USD
6. **No Expense Editing**: Expenses cannot be modified after creation (common in expense tracking apps for audit trail)

## Future Enhancements

- User authentication and authorization
- Expense editing and deletion
- Multiple currency support
- Payment/settlement tracking
- Email notifications
- Mobile app
- Group chat/comments
- Receipt photo uploads
- Expense categories and tags
- Data export functionality
- PostgreSQL support for production
- Redis caching for better performance
- WebSocket support for real-time updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port conflicts**: Change ports in docker-compose.yml if 3001 or 5173 are in use
2. **Database permissions**: Ensure the `./data` directory has proper write permissions
3. **Docker build fails**: Clear Docker cache with `docker system prune -a`
4. **Services not starting**: Check logs with `docker-compose logs [service-name]`

### Health Checks
The backend service includes health checks. Monitor with:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```
